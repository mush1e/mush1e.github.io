      review: "I grew up enjoying Monopoly. Even with its long playing time I would enjoy it. Writing the description and review has brought back many good memories. Now that I am older I am playing different games, games that require more thinking from me and less luck. I am not looking for a luckless game that is pure strategy, but Monopoly has a lot of luck involved. You need to land on the right spaces to get the properties you need, this is pure luck. You will be helped greatly by getting the right cards, again pure luck. Other house rules like putting money in free parking and collecting more for landing on GO just add more luck into the game (and make it play longer). There is skill involved in negotiating deals, and maybe it was just people I played with, but deals were rarely made until almost all the properties were sold."

      review: "Is Monopoly a horrible game? - Absolutely.\nDoes that mean that a round of Monopoly can't be fun? - Absolutely not.It's just not about the game then but about the people. Have a little banter, enjoy the company. Just accept that you won't have a significant impact on how the game plays out, just sit back and see where the dice take you.That said, there are many games that do this which are a lot more fun and don't drag on for several hours (and some that are just as long but at least have some kind of story behind them).So given the choice, I won't ever actively pick Monopoly as the next game to play but if someone else insists, I won't deny them the nostalgia of rolling some dice and laughing at everything going t*ts up while one person continues to get exactly what they need."
