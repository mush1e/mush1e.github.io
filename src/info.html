      <h1>Monopoly: A Brief Overview</h1>

        <section id="history">
          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>Monopoly is a classic board game that was first published in the United States by Parker Brothers in 1935. However, the game's origins can be traced back to a similar game called The Landlord's Game, which was created by Elizabeth Magie in 1903.</p>

          <p>The Landlord's Game was designed to demonstrate the negative aspects of monopolies, and it featured a circular board with spaces that represented different economic principles, such as taxes, rent, and public utilities. Players could buy and sell properties, and the goal was to accumulate wealth while avoiding bankruptcy.</p>
          <p>After Parker Brothers acquired the rights to The Landlord's Game, they made some changes to the rules and board design, and Monopoly was born. The game quickly became popular, and it is now one of the most iconic board games of all time.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Monopoly is the game of economic conquest, and it can be a ruthless and cutthroat affair. But it's also a game of strategy, negotiation, and luck, and that's what makes it so much fun to play."</p>
            <cite> - John Smith, Monopoly Enthusiast</cite>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The game has undergone many different versions and variations over the years, including themed editions based on popular movies, TV shows, and other franchises. However, the classic version of the game remains the most popular and enduring.</p>
          <p>If you've never played Monopoly before, it's time to join in on the fun and see what all the fuss is about!</p>

          <h2>Rules of Game Play</h2>
          <p>The basic rules of Monopoly are relatively simple:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Each player starts with a set amount of money and a game piece that represents them on the board.</li>
            <li>Players take turns rolling dice and moving their game piece around the board.</li>
            <li>If a player lands on a property, they can choose to buy it or let it go up for auction.</li>
            <li>If a player owns all of the properties in a particular color group, they can start building houses and hotels on those properties, which increases the rent that other players must pay when they land on them.</li>
            <li>If a player lands on a space that is not a property, such as a chance or community chest space, they must follow the instructions on the corresponding card.</li>
            <li>If a player lands on a space that is already owned by another player, they must pay rent to the owner based on the value of the property and any improvements that have been made to it.</li>
            <li>If a player lands on a space that is owned by the bank, such as a railroad or utility, they can choose to buy it or let it go up for auction.</li>
            <li>If a player lands on the "Go to Jail" space, they must go directly to jail and cannot collect rent or participate in any transactions until they are released.</li>
            <li>The game continues until one player has bankrupted all the others and has become the sole owner of all the properties on the board.</li>
            </ol>
